10 HTML tags: h1, p, nav, div, button, ul, li, a, img, input,form
5 CSS properties: body, p, #me, #text, .Jack
One-sentence description of how I chose to use JavaScript and Bootstrap: I chose to use the Navbar
from bootstrap because it was going to be helpful when trying to figure out how to move from one
.html page to another and it helped me keep my website organized, I chose to make my website
personalized and used JavaScript to add a feature that responded to the user's input of a name using
querySelector and addEventListener in JavaScript.
